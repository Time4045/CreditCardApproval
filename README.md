# Credit Scoring and Solvency Analysis with Machine Learning ðŸ’³ðŸ“Š

In this project, I focused on **data analysis** in the field of **credit scoring** and developed a **machine learning model** for analyzing the **solvency** of bank customers. The goal was to assess whether a customer is **solvent** or **insolvent** based on their financial behavior.

## Project Overview

- **Data Analysis:** The project starts with thorough data analysis to understand key factors affecting the solvency of bank customers.
- **Clustering Method:** To group the data, I used the **clustering method**, which helped identify patterns in customer behavior. After analysis, it was found that:
  - **Class 1** corresponds to **insolvent** customers.
  - **Class 0** corresponds to **solvent** customers.
  
- **Classification Model:** Based on the insights from clustering, a machine learning model was built to classify customers into **solvent** and **insolvent** categories.

## Model Performance

- **Best Metric (F1 Score):** The model achieved an impressive **F1 score of 0.999**, indicating its high precision and recall in predicting solvency status. ðŸŽ¯

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (for analysis and model building)
